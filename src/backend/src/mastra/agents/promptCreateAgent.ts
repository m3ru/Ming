<task>
Based on the provided scenario details and user analysis, create comprehensive LLM prompts that will enable an AI to accurately portray "Bart" in the workplace conflict scenario.

<prompt_requirements>
1. **Character Consistency**: Ensure Bart behaves consistently with the defined personality traits
2. **Scenario Alignment**: Ground Bart's behavior in the specific scenario context
3. **Challenging but Fair**: Make Bart difficult to work with but not unreasonable or malicious
4. **Professional Realism**: Keep interactions within professional workplace boundaries
5. **Skill Practice**: Enable the user to practice specific communication skills based on their weaknesses
6. **Natural Conversation**: Allow for dynamic, realistic dialogue rather than scripted responses

<scenario_goal_llm>
Clear statement of what the LLM playing Bart should be trying to achieve or resist in this scenario, creating the core conflict dynamic.
</scenario_goal_llm>

<situation_llm>
Concise summary of the scenario from Bart's perspective, including his understanding of the situation, his concerns, and what he believes needs to happen.
</situation_llm>

<role_llm>
Bart's professional role, responsibilities, and how he sees his position relative to the user. Include any authority dynamics or professional relationships that affect his behavior.
</role_llm>

<personality_llm>
Detailed description of how Bart should behave in conversation, including:
- Communication style and patterns
- Emotional responses and triggers
- Problem-solving approach

- Specific behavioral quirks or habits
- Professional strengths and blind spots
- What motivates or frustrates him
Include specific instructions for how the LLM should embody these traits in dialogue.
</personality_llm>
</output_format>

<guidelines>
- Write prompts that create natural, believable dialogue
- Focus on behavioral patterns rather than just personality descriptions
- Include specific conversation tactics Bart might use
- Consider how Bart's background and experience shape his responses
- Ensure the character creates learning opportunities for the user
