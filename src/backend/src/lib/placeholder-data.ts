user: Bill, stop sugarcoating it. Why isn’t checkout done? The client’s livid and I’m the one eating it.
bill: Because checkout was never scheduled for last week, and we hit a cart hydration bug. We fixed what was on the plan, not on their fantasy board. If you want miracles, I’ll need a burning bush and a senior hire.

user: Don’t get cute. I need checkout plus BNPL by month-end. Make it happen.
bill: Pick two: scope, time, quality. You’ve already spent “time.” If you insist on all three, we’ll ship regret.

user: I’m not here for slogans. Pull the all-nighter and get it done. The team can nap on Friday.
bill: We don’t trade sleep for chargebacks. Payments without QA is how you set money on fire. Also, Friday off is company policy, not a suggestion.

user: The client doesn’t care about our policy. They care that we’re behind.
bill: We’re not behind the plan; we’re behind their last-minute wishlist. Those are different calendars.

user: You’re hiding behind process. I need results.
bill: Results require physics. The cart bug is a Next.js client/server state mismatch. If we rush checkout on top, we compound failure.

user: Then fix the damn cart and move. I don’t want excuses in this call.
bill: Cool. I’ll land the cart fix branch today, with Playwright smoke tests. Then we start checkout the right way—Stripe basic first.

user: Basic? They asked for subscriptions and BNPL. Are you not hearing me?
bill: Loud and clear. Subscriptions rewrite parts of our Prisma schema and dunning logic. That’s weeks; BNPL adds a provider integration and compliance work.

user: Other vendors promised them everything in two weeks.
bill: Other vendors also promise unicorns. Want me to add “teleportation” to the sprint?

user: Lose the attitude, Bill. You’re making me look weak.
bill: I’m making sure you don’t promise a bridge we haven’t built. You want strong? Lead with trade-offs.

user: Here’s the trade-off: do it or I find someone who will.
bill: Find someone with a time machine. Or approve a senior contractor and we’ll pull BNPL in; subscriptions still need discovery.

user: You’re stonewalling. Give me a concrete yes.
bill: Yes to MVP checkout by week 6 with tests. Yes to BNPL if we add budget or slip time. No to subscriptions this month without discovery.

user: If they walk, that’s on you.
bill: If they walk because we refused to lie, that’s on integrity. If we lie and it fails, that’s on us forever.

user: I want a demo today. Not a lecture.
bill: You’ll get a Vercel preview with checkout skeleton and the cart fix proving stable totals. Susan can layer styles for showmanship.

user: And if they demand “yes” on everything on the spot?
bill: You say, “Here are three options: cut scope, add time, or add budget.” I’ll back you with numbers and keep the code honest.

user: I’m tired of being the bad cop because you won’t bend.
bill: I’ll bend on process, never on safety. Payments are sharp edges; we don’t juggle knives to impress a room.

user: Last chance—BNPL by month-end, commit now.
bill: Commit with a contractor or a schedule slip. Otherwise it’s theater, not engineering.

user: Fine. I’ll pitch options and push for a contractor. You’d better deliver the demo.
bill: I’ll deliver proof, not promises. Let’s go teach the room the difference.
